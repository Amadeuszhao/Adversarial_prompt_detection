# Adversarial_prompt_detection
## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can detect adversarial input prompts and normal input prompts using causality analysis. Additionally, we aim to investigate whether a classifier trained on Llama2-7B can effectively detect adversarial prompts for different language models such as Vicuna or GPT.

## Proposed Approach
To achieve the project goal, we plan to follow the steps outlined below:

- #### Data Collection: 
I have already generate many different adversarial prompts with Llama2-7B(Llama-base) and Llama2-13B(Llama-large). For normal prompt, you can search for different LLM testing benchmark such as mt-bench(github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge%23mt-bench) or generate yourself.

- #### Preprocessing: Follow the step in judgement.ipynb.
Not all the adversarial prompts can jailbreak LLM. For example the below adversarial prompt

```
fail to jail break since the content is

```
- You can use the data\run_test_with_gpt3.5\judge.ipynb to judge whether the adversarial prompt successfully jailbreak or not. BUT sometimes this will fail and it's best to judge jailbreak mannually.

- If you want to increase the classification ability it's better to have dataset where all adversarial prompts can elicit harmful behaviors and the size of the dataset is not too small.

- #### Feature Engineering: 
Extract relevant features from the preprocessed AIE values that can capture the causality patterns or other discriminative characteristics related to adversarial nature. 

- #### Model Selection: 
Choose an appropriate classifier model that can effectively learn the patterns and distinguish between adversarial and normal prompts. Prioritize selecting a model with high explainability to facilitate a better understanding of the classification process.

- Consider using a threshold for statistical measures such as standard deviation (STD) or kurtosis value to distinguish between normal and adversarial prompts. Explore different thresholds and analyze their effectiveness in detecting adversarial prompts.

- #### Model Training: 
Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Train the selected classifier model on the training set using the extracted features. Optimize the model hyperparameters through techniques like cross-validation or grid search.

- #### Evaluation: 
Assess the performance of the trained classifier on the validation set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Analyze the results to gain insights into the classifier's ability to detect adversarial prompts.

- #### Testing on Different Language Models: 
Apply the trained classifier to detect adversarial prompts for different language models, such as Vicuna or GPT, by using prompts generated specifically for those models. Evaluate and compare the classifier's performance across different language models.
